# OpenClique - Quest with Us

> OpenClique is a social platform launching in Austin that helps people make real-world friendships through small squad activities called "quests."

## What is OpenClique?

OpenClique matches you with 3-5 compatible people based on your interests, vibe, and availability. Our AI curates fun activities ("quests") like trying a new coffee shop, playing pickleball, or exploring a local brewery. You just show up—no awkward planning required.

## How It Works

1. **Take the Quiz** - Answer questions about your interests, personality, and availability
2. **Get Matched** - Our AI groups you with compatible people into small squads
3. **Receive Quests** - Get curated activity suggestions based on your squad's shared interests
4. **Show Up & Connect** - Meet your squad, complete quests, and build real friendships
