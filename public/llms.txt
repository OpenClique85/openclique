# OpenClique — You've Got a Squad Waiting

> You've got a squad waiting. You just haven't met them yet. We plan the adventure—you bring yourself, plus whoever you want.

## What is OpenClique?

OpenClique is a social platform launching in Austin that helps people make real-world friendships through small squad activities called "quests." Come solo and get matched, bring a friend and expand your circle, or rally your crew to something new. We handle the planning—you just show up.

## How It Works

1. **Match** - Sign up, tell us your interests, and get matched with your squad
2. **Meet** - Show up at curated adventures designed for small groups
3. **Return** - Keep questing with the people you vibe with

## Key Features
